# Trivia Python simply use's opentdb's API to pull in a random trivia question. This has been designed to be answered from the command line.

Made in 2018 after playing Tower Unite: https://store.steampowered.com/app/394690/Tower_Unite/

Tower Unite contains a trivia mini-game where it pulls questions from opentdb, so thought I'd remake it in CLI form for fun!

Code needs optimising, lots of repitition!
Currently handles 1 question before exiting.
No scoring system.

Hasn't been updated since I made it, so there's a lot of stuff I'd change looking back on it :)

Hopefully someone finds it useful!
